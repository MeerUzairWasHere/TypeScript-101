// Intersection Types

// In TypeScript, an intersection type (TypeA & TypeB) is a way of combining multiple types into one. This means that an object of an intersection type will have all the properties of TypeA and all the properties of TypeB. It's a way of creating a new type that merges the properties of existing types.

type Book = { id: number; name: string; price: number };

type DiscountedBook = Book & { discount: number };

const book1: Book = {
  id: 2,
  name: "How to Cook a Dragon",
  price: 15,
};

const book2: Book = {
  id: 3,
  name: "The Secret Life of Unicorns",
  price: 18,
};

const discountedBook: DiscountedBook = {
  id: 4,
  name: "Gnomes vs. Goblins: The Ultimate Guide",
  price: 25,
  discount: 0.15,
};
